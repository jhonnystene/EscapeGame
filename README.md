# Escape The Robots And Oh Gosh They're Coming Run
A game made in Java for compsci class

##### Running The Game
Run the jarfile or click the run button in Eclipse my guy.
Most of the game's assets are downloaded from the internet into RAM. This can take time if you're on a slow connection.
A white screen while starting does NOT mean the game doesn't work. Give it a few seconds, it's downloading assets needed for the main menu.
If there's an error, the game window will tell you.
