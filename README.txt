Escape The Robots And Oh Gosh They're Coming Run
A game made for my computer science class. Version 1.1b in development.

DEBUGGING:
    Set DEBUG_BUILD (in com.boiswhodontknowhowtocompsci.EscapeGameComponent) to true.
    This will enable the better crash handler, and a separate menu that lets you:
        - Set the player's position in the world
            Pressing X on the debug window will let you type a new X value into the console.
            Pressing Y on the debug window will let you type a new Y value into the console.
        - View the player's position in the world
        - View the count of collision objects in the world
        - View the count of pickups in the world
        - View the current map ID

COMPILING:
    Open the project in Eclipse or IntelliJ.
    Build a JAR from the src/ folder with the main class set to com.boiswhodontknowhowtocompsci.EscapeGameComponent.
